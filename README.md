# Simulator_Bus_Traffic_Luxembourg
Simulates where and when the buses in Luxembourg are and how they move from one point to another.

**Currently only contains RGTR buslines**
Last Updated: 05/June/2021

Displays a map with markers which represent the different buses.
They move from one stop to another in the time they are given by the timetable, so if a bus should be on stop 1 on 10:00 and on stop 2 at 10:01, it will take exactly 1 minute on the map too for the marker to move.
